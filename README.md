# Assignment2: UVM-based FIFO Verification Environment

## Overview
This project implements a Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) testbench for verifying a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) hardware module in SystemVerilog. The environment includes both a UVM-based and a basic SystemVerilog testbench for comparison and learning purposes.

## Directory Structure
- `fifo.sv`         : RTL implementation of the FIFO module.
- `fifo_if.sv`      : SystemVerilog interface for connecting the testbench and DUT.
- `agent_config.sv` : UVM configuration object for agent settings and virtual interface.
- `tx_item.sv`      : UVM sequence item (transaction) definition.
- `tx_sequence.sv`  : UVM sequence generating stimulus for the FIFO.
- `tx_sequencer.sv` : UVM sequencer for driving sequences.
- `tx_driver.sv`    : UVM driver to drive transactions onto the interface.
- `tx_monitor.sv`   : UVM monitor to sample DUT inputs and outputs.
- `tx_agent.sv`     : UVM agent encapsulating driver, monitor, and sequencer.
- `scoreboard.sv`   : UVM scoreboard for checking DUT output correctness.
- `tx_env.sv`       : UVM environment connecting agent and scoreboard.
- `fifo_test.sv`    : UVM test that runs the sequence and checks results.
- `tx_pkg.sv`       : UVM package including all UVM components.
- `top.sv`          : Top-level module instantiating the DUT, interface, and starting the UVM test.
- `run.do`          : Questa/ModelSim script to compile and run the simulation.
- `testbench.sv`    : Basic (non-UVM) SystemVerilog testbench for FIFO.
- `classes.sv`      : Classes for the basic testbench (transaction, generator, driver, monitor, scoreboard).
- `certe_dump.xml`  : Tool-generated XML for UVM hierarchy and connections.
- `transcript`      : Simulator output log.

## How It Works
- The UVM testbench instantiates a FIFO DUT and connects it via a virtual interface.
- The agent generates transactions (write/read) and drives them to the DUT.
- The monitor samples both input and output, sending them to the scoreboard.
- The scoreboard compares expected and actual outputs, reporting matches/mismatches.
- The test is started from `top.sv` using `run_test("fifo_test")`.

## Running the Simulation
1. Open Questa/ModelSim in this directory.
2. Run the provided script:
   ```
   do run.do
   ```
3. View the simulation results and UVM report in the transcript.

## File Descriptions
### RTL & Interface
- **fifo.sv**: Parameterized FIFO RTL with write/read logic, full/empty flags.
- **fifo_if.sv**: Interface for connecting testbench and DUT, with modports for direction control.

### UVM Testbench
- **agent_config.sv**: Holds agent configuration and virtual interface handle.
- **tx_item.sv**: Defines the transaction (data/control signals) for FIFO operations.
- **tx_sequence.sv**: Generates a sequence of write/read transactions.
- **tx_sequencer.sv**: Manages the order of transaction execution.
- **tx_driver.sv**: Drives transactions onto the interface.
- **tx_monitor.sv**: Observes interface signals and forwards them for checking.
- **tx_agent.sv**: Bundles driver, monitor, and sequencer.
- **scoreboard.sv**: Compares expected and actual FIFO outputs.
- **tx_env.sv**: Connects agent and scoreboard.
- **fifo_test.sv**: Top-level UVM test that runs the sequence and checks results.
- **tx_pkg.sv**: UVM package including all components.

### Top-level & Scripts
- **top.sv**: Instantiates DUT, interface, and starts the UVM test.
- **run.do**: Script to compile and run the simulation.

### Basic Testbench (Non-UVM)
- **testbench.sv**: Simple testbench for FIFO.
- **classes.sv**: Transaction, generator, driver, monitor, scoreboard classes for basic testbench.

### Miscellaneous
- **certe_dump.xml**: UVM hierarchy and connection dump (for debug/analysis).
- **transcript**: Simulator output log.

## Notes
- The UVM testbench is modular and reusable for FIFO-like designs.
- The basic testbench is included for reference and learning.
- Make sure Questa/ModelSim and UVM libraries are properly installed.
